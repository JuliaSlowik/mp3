# GUI XD

## Why this module?
So I browsed through some websites, looking for a nice and relatively easy GUI module - what I found was wxPython (available here: https://wxpython.org/
The main reason why I decided to choose this module was because it's cross-platform and (at least in theory) this should make it easier for us to implement it across various platforms.

## Instalation: 
`pip install -U wxPython`
Should do the trick.

## Here's me pretending I understand what I'm doing:
